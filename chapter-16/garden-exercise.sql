/* 16.4.4. Sub-Queries and Complex Queries.
/*
1. When we were writing our joins, you may have noticed that the information that 
   was most helpful to you (the plant_name) was missing from the result set! 
   Write a query that gets the name of the plant by joining the plant table on 
   the result set of the inner join query above. 
   Hint: Open the query tab with the inner join query and copy it into a new 
   query tab to start. Once you have your inner join setup in a new query tab, 
   it will be easier to write your subquery.
*/
/*
2. Letâ€™s say our plant table is so large that we have no idea what the plant_id 
   for a hosta is. All we know is that there is definitely a row for hostas in 
   the plant table. 
   Write a query that will insert a new row into our seeds table. 
   This new row needs to show that we received 100 hosta seeds that will 
   expire on 08/05/2020 (so no need to reorder!) and for the plant_id, 
   use a query inside the INSERT statement to get the appropriate ID for hostas. 
   Hint: In order to get the plant_id of a hosta, you can use the following 
   query in one line 
   `SELECT plant_id FROM plant WHERE (plant_name LIKE 'Hosta')`
   inside the VALUES of the INSERT statement.
 */

/* 16.4.5. Bonus Misson */
/* 1. Revisit your query with a full join and try using UNION ALL 
	  as opposed to UNION. How does the result set differ? 
 */
/* 2. Now that we can get the plant_name of plants that we have seeds for 
      and are in the garden bed, try using COUNT() to see how many plants 
      are in both places.
